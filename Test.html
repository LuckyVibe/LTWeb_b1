                            <u>Lorem Ipsum</u> is simply dummy text of the printing

                            and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the 
                            <br>
                            industry's standard dummy text ever since the 
                            <br>
                            1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of
                            <br>
                            type and scrambled it to make a type specimen
                            <br>
                            book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also
                            <br>
                            the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining 
                            <br>
                            essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the

                            Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not
                            <br>
                            simply random text. It has roots in a piece of 
                            <br>
                            classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over

                            2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin

                            <br>
                            looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, 
                            <br>
                            consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and

                            going through the cites of the word in classical

                            literature, discovered the undoubtable source.

                            Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and

                            distracted by the readable content of a page when

                            looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum 
                            <br>
                            is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of

                            now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, 
                            <br>
                            and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many

                            web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have

                            evolved over the years, sometimes by accident,

                            There are many variations of passages of Lorem 
                            <br>
                            Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered

                            alteration in some form, by injected humour, or

                            <br>
                            believable. If you are going to use a passage of

                            Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't

                            All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend

                            this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a

                            dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a

                            handful of model sentence structures, to generate
